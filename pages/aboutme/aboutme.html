                Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Noe Jager, and I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Montreal. 
                While I spend most of my time studying and enjoying life in Montreal, this year, I've given myself the mission to work on a variety of projects 
                to expand my horizons and explore different domains. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In the summer of 2022, I completed my bachelor's degree at the University of Luxembourg, known for its modernity and its 93 world ranking in Computer Science 
                (Times Higher Education ranking 2022). Eager to explore the 'France in America', I embarked on a journey to Montreal. 
                Fluent in four languages (French, English, German, Japanese), I have gained valuable experience from a diverse range of projects undertaken during my bachelor studies, 
                often in collaboration with esteemed researchers. 
                These projects spanned areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics like my <a href="../projects/projects.html#2"> Q Learning for a drone in a simulated environment</a> 
                and <a href="../projects/projects.html#1">Control of a group of drone with Unreal Engine 4 using Python</a> projects, and  Human-Computer Interaction, and Computer Vision 
                with <a href="../projects/projects.html#5">Design of a privacy app with Figma</a> and <a href="../projects/projects.html#6">Drawing with a webcam</a>. 
                I invite you to explore my <a href="../education/education.html">Education</a> and <a href="../projects/projects.html">Projects</a> pages for further insights into my academic and professional journey.
