            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p> 
                Hi, my name is Noé Jager, I am a master student in Computer Science. Through my university years, <br>
                I have developed a diverse skillset in programming applications, and a hunger for new challenges. <br>
                Since my first university year, I have accumulated a wealth of programing experience and computer <br>
                knowledge in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Data Science/Data Visualizations. <br>
                Please feel free to explore my portfolio, and I'd be delighted to discuss potential opportunities for collaboration. <br>
